    "By examining the data from 2021 and 2020 I hope to examine the impacts the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the Leaving Certificate. As the last two years have seen a change in how the Leaving Certificate is examined it will be interesting to see if this has had an affect on the course points. As the data from the CAO are not synonymous for comparing the 2021 and 2020 data to the data from years previous I will group the 2021 and 2020 data together for analysis and then group 2019 to 2017 (inclusive) together for analysis. \n",

The same stands for R2 points for 2021 and 2020 as the data for R2 points is also extremely patchy this will not be examined. -->\n",
